You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can take the steps either 1 or 2 at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

Example

For n = 1, the output should be
solution(n) = 1;

For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 2.

You can either climb 2 steps at once or climb 1 step two times.

Input/Output
