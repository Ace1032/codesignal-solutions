Practicing Dynamic Programming is highly beneficial before a technical interview as it enhances problem-solving skills and equips candidates 
with a strategic approach to optimizing solutions. Dynamic Programming involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable 
subproblems and solving them systematically. This technique not only fosters a deeper understanding of algorithmic principles but also 
improves efficiency and reduces time complexity. Given that technical interviews often involve solving intricate coding challenges within 
a limited timeframe, a solid grasp of Dynamic Programming allows candidates to approach problems methodically, identify recurring patterns, 
and devise optimal solutions. Familiarity with Dynamic Programming instills confidence, enabling candidates to tackle a diverse range of 
algorithmic problems and showcase their problem-solving prowess during interviews. Ultimately, consistent practice in Dynamic Programming 
empowers individuals to navigate interview scenarios with ease and precision, demonstrating their ability to devise efficient and scalable 
solutions to complex computational challenges.
